# Qt Calculator

The goal of this project is to create your own calculator application for computers using the Qt framework. The main objective of the project is to implement a calculator that uses strings instead of numeric data types. \
The layout of the buttons was based on the interface of the calculator on Android. All numbers used in the calculator are stored only in string format, which allows you to calculate incredibly large numbers. Also, division is performed with an accuracy of up to 10 digits. The calculator uses the Polish notation algorithm, which allows you to accurately determine the order of operations. \
The calculator also has a saved input history, which is dynamically updated as you use the calculator.
